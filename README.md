# Importance_Sampling
Daily demand for a newspaper is approx gamma distributed, with mean 10,000 and variance 1,000,000. The newspaper prints and distributes 11,000 copies each day. The profit on each newspaper sold is $1, and the loss on each unsold newspaper is $0.25.

Express the expected daily profit as a finite integral and estimate using Monte Carlo integration. Improve your Monte Carlo using importance sampling.
